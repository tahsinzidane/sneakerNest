# SneakerNest üõçÔ∏è  

**SneakerNest** is a single-vendor e-commerce platform designed for selling sneakers, hoodies, and full-sleeve T-shirts during winter. The primary purpose of this project is to test my backend development skills and explore how well I can handle server-side functionality, database integration, and user authentication.  

---

## Current Status  

This project is a **work in progress**, and the backend is the main area of focus. While the basic structure and features are functional, there‚Äôs still a lot to improve and polish before it can be considered complete.  

---

## Key Highlights  

- **Dynamic Product Management**: Products can be displayed with details like price, description, stock availability, and tags.  
- **Authentication**: Basic user login and registration using Passport.js (local strategy and Google OAuth).  
- **Backend Focus**: Testing my abilities in building APIs, integrating MongoDB, and implementing secure features.  
- **Templating**: Using EJS for server-side rendering to dynamically display data.
